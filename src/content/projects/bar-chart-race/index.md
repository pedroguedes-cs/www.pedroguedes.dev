summary: "A C++ program that reads structured data and generates an animated bar chart race visualization"
description: "A C++ program that reads a structured text file (.txt) following a custom CSV-like format. and transforms the data into an animated bar chart race visualization. The system parses time-series datasets and dynamically renders ranked bars over time, creating a smooth “race” effect that highlights changes in values and positions across different categories. The project focuses on file parsing, data structures, sorting algorithms, and real-time console/graphical rendering to simulate data evolution visually."
